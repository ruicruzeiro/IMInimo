This is the repository of a web app called IMInimo. It helps users to figure out if they can save on property taxes in Portugal.

It allows the upload of a registry document, extracts its information using regex, and computes possible savings. It also allows the user to input their own information, in case they don't want to upload the document.

It uses Python and Flask for the backend. The CSS stylesheet was created by me (no Bootstrap).

Deployed on November 6th 2024.
